## About FBF.SVG Format

**FBF.SVG** (Frame-by-Frame SVG) is a proposed **candidate substandard of the SVG specification**, analogous to SVG Tiny and SVG Basic. It defines a constrained, optimized profile for declarative frame-by-frame animations that are valid SVG 1.1/2.0 documents with additional structural and conformance requirements.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/quote_aqua_transparent.svg" alt="Why we need a vector video format - quote from FBF.SVG creator" width="100%" style="max-width: 1200px; height: auto;"/>
</p>

### Design Principles

The FBF.SVG format is designed around eight core principles:

1. **SVG Compatibility** - Every FBF.SVG document is a valid SVG document
2. **Declarative Animation** - Uses SMIL timing, not imperative scripting
3. **Security First** - No external resources; strict Content Security Policy compliance
4. **Optimization** - Smart deduplication and shared definitions minimize file size
5. **Validatability** - Mechanically validatable against formal schema
6. **Self-Documentation** - Comprehensive embedded metadata in RDF/XML format
7. **Streaming Architecture** - Unlimited real-time frame addition without playback interruption
8. **Interactive Visual Communication** - Bidirectional LLM-to-user visual interaction protocol

### Format Specification & Schema

**📂 [FBF.SVG Format Standard](FBF.SVG/)** — Complete format specification in dedicated folder

Core documents:
- **📋 [Specification](FBF.SVG/FBF_SVG_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Complete format specification
- **📐 [XML Schema (XSD)](FBF.SVG/fbf-svg.xsd)** - Formal schema definition for validation
- **📊 [Metadata Spec](FBF.SVG/FBF_METADATA_SPEC.md)** - RDF/XML metadata requirements
- **📝 [Format Guide](FBF.SVG/FBF_FORMAT.md)** - Technical implementation details
- **📄 [Proposal](FBF.SVG/FBF_SVG_PROPOSAL.md)** - Original proposal with use cases

The specification defines two conformance levels:
- **FBF.SVG Basic** - Core structural and animation requirements
- **FBF.SVG Full** - Adds comprehensive RDF/XML metadata

The **svg2fbf** tool generates FBF.SVG Full conformant documents.

**📝 Note on Alembic:** Alembic is included in this comparison because it's sometimes suggested for exporting animations from OpenToonz. **Alembic IS valuable for interoperability** - it's a **scene hierarchy editing format** that allows OpenToonz to exchange layered 2D/3D scene hierarchies (including z-depth for parallax effects) with other animation tools like Blender, Maya, and Houdini. However, **Alembic and FBF.SVG serve different purposes that don't interfere with each other**: Alembic is for **editing** (scene hierarchy interchange between professional tools), while FBF.SVG is for **output** (deployable vector video standard). Alembic cannot be played in browsers, mobile apps, or displayed directly as animation for public consumption. Use Alembic for production pipeline interchange (OpenToonz ↔ Blender), and FBF.SVG (or video export) for deploying animations to end users.

### 💡 The Verdict

**FBF.SVG is the ONLY format that:**
- ✅ Is a standard SVG image (not code, not proprietary data)
- ✅ Requires ZERO code at every stage (create, edit, play)
- ✅ Costs $0 for everything (tools, runtime, per-app, exports)
- ✅ Works EVERYWHERE (web, mobile, desktop, video editors, games)
- ✅ Opens in millions of applications (Inkscape, Illustrator, Final Cut, browsers, mobile apps, game engines, etc.)
- ✅ Eliminates need for programmers (artists-only workflow)

**Table Legend:**
- ✅ **YES** = Fully supported without limitations
- ✅ YES, but [condition] = Supported with specific requirement or cost
- ❌ NO, [reason] = Not supported, with explanation
- ❌ **NO** = Not supported at all

### Understanding the Difference: Formats vs. Implementation Methods

It's important to distinguish between **deliverable animation formats** (what you ship) and **implementation methods** (how you code them):

**Deliverable Formats (this table):**
- **FBF.SVG** — Self-contained SVG file (0 code required)
- **Lottie** — JSON file + JavaScript runtime (code required)
- **Rive** — .riv file + proprietary runtime (code required)
- **Adobe Animate** — Various exports (SVG, Canvas, Video)

**Implementation Methods (NOT competing formats):**
- **SMIL** — Part of SVG standard (FBF.SVG uses this internally!)
- **CSS Animations** — Requires writing CSS code
- **Web Animations API** — Requires writing JavaScript code
- **JavaScript Libraries** — Requires writing/loading code (Snap.svg, GSAP, etc.)

**Why this matters:** FBF.SVG uses SMIL internally, but that's transparent to users. You never write SMIL code — you create frames visually and svg2fbf generates the animation automatically. In contrast, CSS and WAAPI require you to write code yourself.

### Why FBF.SVG Stands Out: A Standard Image File, Not Code

Looking at the table above, FBF.SVG is the **only deliverable format** that is a **pure image file with ZERO CODE**:

**📄 It's Just an Image File!**

FBF.SVG output is a **perfectly standard SVG image file** — the same format used for logos, icons, and illustrations everywhere:
- **Not a code file** — It's an image, like a .jpg or .png
- **Not a data file** — It's not JSON, XML, or binary data that needs interpretation
- **Not a script** — Contains zero lines of JavaScript or CSS
- **Just SVG** — Pure W3C SVG markup, understood by millions of applications

**🌍 Universal Compatibility:**

> **"Anything can play an FBF.SVG video. Anything! If it supports SVG 1.1, it can reproduce it!"**

**This means:**
- ✅ Open it in **Adobe Illustrator** — it works
- ✅ Open it in **Inkscape** — it works and you can edit it
- ✅ Open it in **Google Chrome** — it works and animates
- ✅ Open it in **Final Cut Pro** — it works
- ✅ Use it in **game engines** (Unity, Godot, etc.) — it works as texture sequence
- ✅ Send it in an **email** — recipient can open it, no special software
- ✅ Upload to **any website** — it just works, no code deployment
- ✅ Import into **any design tool** — Figma, Sketch, Canva, all work

**🎯 ZERO CODE at Every Stage:**
1. **Creation** — Draw frames in Inkscape/Krita/Blender, no coding
2. **Processing** — svg2fbf generates the image file, no coding
3. **The File Itself** — Pure SVG image, contains zero code
4. **Editing** — Edit the image in any SVG graphic app, no coding
5. **Playback** — Open the image file in browser, it animates (no JavaScript needed)

**🎨 Artist-Friendly Workflow:**
- Create animation frames in familiar visual tools
- No need to learn coding, JavaScript, or CSS
- Edit output directly in Inkscape, Illustrator, etc.
- True round-trip workflow: edit → export → edit again

**🛠️ Developer-Friendly Format:**

A company that wants to create a graphic editor for FBF.SVG **doesn't need to support the complexity of a CSS rendering engine or a JavaScript runtime!** All it needs is to support the plain, bare **SVG 1.1 or SVG 2.0 standard**.

- ✅ **Simple implementation** — Just implement SVG standard
- ✅ **No CSS engine required** — Zero CSS to parse or render
- ✅ **No JavaScript runtime required** — Zero scripts to execute
- ✅ **Lower complexity** — Smaller codebase, fewer bugs
- ✅ **Faster development** — Build tools faster
- ✅ **Better performance** — Native rendering, no scripting overhead

**🔓 No Vendor Lock-in:**
- Output is standard SVG (works in any SVG tool)
- Not tied to proprietary editor or runtime
- Can switch tools at any time
- Future-proof: based on W3C standard

**📦 Self-Contained & Universal:**
- Single SVG file, no external dependencies
- No JavaScript bundle to load (~0KB vs. Lottie's 160KB)
- Works everywhere: web, print, video editors, presentations
- Native browser performance, hardware-accelerated

**💰 Economic Advantages:**

> **"With FBF.SVG there is no need to hire programmers anymore to create animations. Artists are all you need."**

- **Lower production costs** — No need for programming team
- **Faster hiring** — Artists are easier to find than animation programmers
- **Simpler workflow** — Artists work with familiar visual tools
- **No code maintenance** — Zero codebase to debug or update
- **Apache 2.0 license** — Permissive, commercial-friendly
- **Works with free tools** — Inkscape, Krita, OpenToonz, Blender
- **No subscription fees** — No runtime licensing costs
- **No distribution fees** — Free for commercial streaming

**When to Choose FBF.SVG:**
- ✅ Frame-by-frame vector animation (cartoons, anime, traditional animation)
- ✅ Want complete workflow without writing any code
- ✅ Need standard SVG output editable in graphic applications
- ✅ Require self-contained files with 0 external dependencies
- ✅ Building with free/open source tools
- ✅ Need true bidirectional workflow (edit anywhere, anytime)
- ✅ JavaScript-free playback for performance/security
- ✅ Commercial projects requiring permissive licensing

**When to Consider Alternatives:**
- **Lottie**: Already invested in After Effects, comfortable with JavaScript runtime dependency
- **Rive**: Need interactive game-like animations with complex state machines and don't mind proprietary format
- **Adobe Animate**: Already have Creative Cloud subscription, need multiple export formats
- **Spine**: Building 2D games with skeletal animation, need advanced rigging

## SVG ViewBox Repair Utility

svg2fbf includes a **viewBox repair utility** (`svg-repair-viewbox`) that automatically calculates and adds viewBox attributes to SVG files using Puppeteer/headless Chrome for accurate bounding box calculation.

### Why ViewBox Repair?

Many SVG files lack proper viewBox attributes, which can cause:
- Incorrect rendering dimensions
- Frame-to-frame jumping in animations
- Scaling and positioning issues

The repair utility uses Puppeteer's `getBBox()` to calculate actual content bounds including fill, stroke, and markers.

### Automatic Dependency Installation

**No manual setup required!** On first use, `svg-repair-viewbox` will automatically:

1. ✅ Detect your operating system and package manager
2. ✅ Install Node.js if not already present (using brew/apt/dnf/pacman/choco)
3. ✅ Install Puppeteer globally

Just run the command and it handles everything!

### Usage

```bash
# Repair a single SVG file
svg-repair-viewbox image.svg

# Repair multiple SVG files (animation sequence)
svg-repair-viewbox frame001.svg frame002.svg frame003.svg

# Repair all SVG files in a directory
svg-repair-viewbox /path/to/svg/directory

# Quiet mode (no progress output)
svg-repair-viewbox --quiet *.svg
```

### Animation Sequence Mode

For animation sequences, the utility uses a **union bbox strategy**:

1. Calculates individual bounding box for each frame
2. Computes union bbox that encompasses all frames
3. Applies the SAME viewBox to ALL frames

This ensures consistent dimensions across all frames, preventing frame-to-frame jumping in animations.

### Example Output

**First run** (automatic dependency installation):

```bash
$ svg-repair-viewbox /tmp/animation_frames

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Simple animation from folder
svg2fbf -i svg_frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg -s 24

# Loop animation
svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f loop.fbf.svg -a loop -s 12

# Animation starts on click
svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f interactive.fbf.svg -s 24 -p

# Process only the first 10 frames
svg2fbf -i large_animation/ -o output/ -f preview.fbf.svg -s 12 -m 10

# Suppress status messages
svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg -s 24 -q
```

### Using FBF Generation Cards

A **FBF Generation Card** is a declarative YAML configuration file that specifies all parameters needed to generate an FBF.SVG animation. Generation cards enable reproducible, version-controlled animation builds and serve as documentation of your animation's configuration.

Create a generation card file:

```yaml
# config.yaml
metadata:
  title: "My Animation"
  creators: "Your Name"

generation_parameters:
  input_folder: "frames/"
  output_path: "output/"
  filename: "animation.fbf.svg"
  speed: 24.0
  animation_type: "loop"
```

Run with generation card:

```bash
# Use generation card
svg2fbf my_animation_card.yaml

# Override generation card settings with CLI
svg2fbf my_animation_card.yaml --speed 30.0 --title "Custom Title"
```

**Creating Your FBF Animations:**

1. **Prepare SVG frames**: Create a sequence of SVG files (frame_001.svg, frame_002.svg, ...)
2. **Organize folder**: Place all frames in a single folder
3. **Create generation card**: Use the generation-card template or the examples cards as starting point
4. **Run svg2fbf**: Execute with your generation card
5. **Test output**: Open the generated FBF file in a browser (Google Chrome recommended for best svg standard support)

**Recommended SVG Creation Tools**:
- **[Inkscape](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape)** - Full-featured SVG editor with mesh gradient support
- **[OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz)** - Professional 2D animation software with SVG export
- **[Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender)** (Grease Pencil) - 3D software with powerful 2D animation tools and SVG export

## FBF Generation Cards

### What Are Generation Cards?

**FBF Generation Cards** (also called **fbf-generation-cards**) are declarative YAML-based configuration files that specify all parameters needed to generate a complete FBF.SVG animation. They serve as:

- **Project blueprints** - Complete specification of animation configuration in version-control-friendly YAML format
- **Reproducible builds** - Generate identical animations across different machines and time periods
- **Documentation** - Self-documenting animation metadata and parameters
- **Automation** - Enable scripted batch animation generation and CI/CD workflows

Every example in the `examples/` directory includes a generation card, making it easy to understand and replicate each animation's configuration.


### Using Generation Cards

**Generate an animation from a generation card:**

```bash
# Run with generation card
svg2fbf examples/splat_button/splat_button.yaml

# Override generation card settings with CLI
svg2fbf examples/splat_button/splat_button.yaml --speed 30 --quiet
```
**📖 For complete documentation, see [FBF Generation Cards Guide](docs/FBF_GENERATION_CARDS.md)**

**📝 For a ready-to-use template, see [Generation Card Template](templates/generation-card-template.yaml)**

For comprehensive information about generation cards and all available configuration options, see:
- **[FBF Generation Cards Documentation](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Complete guide to creating and using generation cards

### How svg2fbf Works

svg2fbf implements a multi-phase transformation pipeline that converts a temporally-ordered sequence of SVG documents into a single FBF.SVG animation. The transformation process applies element deduplication algorithms, gradient merging optimizations, and SMIL timing generation to produce compact, self-contained animated SVG documents.

#### FBF File Structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="FBF.SVG/fbf_schema.svg" alt="FBF File Structure Schema" width="900"/>
</p>

**Complete FBF Structure Tree:**

```
SVG Root
├── metadata (optional)
├── desc (required)
├── ANIMATION_BACKDROP
│   ├── STAGE_BACKGROUND (Z-order: behind animation)
│   ├── ANIMATION_STAGE
│   │   └── ANIMATED_GROUP
│   │       └── PROSKENION
│   │           └── <animate>
│   └── STAGE_FOREGROUND (Z-order: in front of animation)
├── OVERLAY_LAYER (Z-order: superimposed on all)
├── defs
│   ├── SHARED_DEFINITIONS
│   └── FRAME00001, FRAME00002, ...
└── script (optional, last)
```

**Strict Element Ordering** (mandatory for specification conformance):

The FBF.SVG specification mandates a deterministic hierarchical structure with precise element ordering. This structural constraint enables FBF-conformant renderers to perform efficient parsing, predictable streaming, and safe runtime composition via three designated extension points:

1. **SVG root** → `<metadata>` (optional) → `<desc>` (required)
2. **ANIMATION_BACKDROP** (`<g>`) — *Extensibility point for layered composition*
   - **STAGE_BACKGROUND** (`<g>`) — Background layer (Z-order: behind animation, dynamic API)
   - **ANIMATION_STAGE** (`<g>`) — Animation container
     - **ANIMATED_GROUP** (`<g>`) — Timing orchestration
       - **PROSKENION** (`<use>`) — Frame reference with SMIL `<animate>` child
   - **STAGE_FOREGROUND** (`<g>`) — Foreground layer (Z-order: in front of animation, dynamic API)
3. **OVERLAY_LAYER** (`<g>`) — Overlay layer (Z-order: superimposed on all, dynamic API for badges/titles/logos/subtitles/borders/PiP)
4. **defs** — All reusable definitions in strict order:
   - **SHARED_DEFINITIONS** (first child) — Shared elements (gradients, symbols, paths)
   - **FRAME00001, FRAME00002, FRAME00003, ...** (sequential) — Individual frames
5. **script** (optional, last) — Mesh gradient polyfill only

**Structural Rationale:**
- **Streaming Optimization**: Deterministic element ordering enables single-pass parsing without full DOM traversal or backtracking
- **Safe Composition**: Three designated extension point groups (STAGE_BACKGROUND, STAGE_FOREGROUND, OVERLAY_LAYER) permit runtime content injection without corrupting required animation structure
- **Z-Order Layering**: Prescribed nesting order establishes three composable layers with deterministic rendering precedence (background < animation < foreground < overlay)
- **Security Validation**: Structural constraints enable mechanical verification of conformance and prevention of element injection attacks

### Advanced Capabilities: Streaming & Interactive Visual Communication

FBF.SVG provides architectural support for two advanced use cases that extend beyond traditional frame-by-frame animation:

#### 🌊 Real-Time Streaming Architecture
The frames-at-end structural design enables dynamic frame appending during playback:
- **Live presentations**: Real-time vector conversion of presentation slides, whiteboard captures, or screen recordings
- **LLM-generated content**: On-demand AI generation of character poses, scene elements, or interface components
- **Remote vector rendering**: Resolution-independent remote desktop visualization
- **Synchronized narrative visualization**: Dynamic scene generation coordinated with textual or audio content

The specification's requirement that frame definitions appear after the animation control structure permits incremental frame appending without interrupting SMIL playback state, enabling streaming applications including live data visualization, interactive tutorials, and real-time generative art.

#### 🤖 Interactive Visual Communication Protocol
FBF.SVG supports bidirectional visual communication between language models and users through declarative SVG generation:

**Traditional Text-Based Interaction**: LLM emits textual procedure description → User parses natural language → Potential comprehension errors for spatial/visual tasks

**FBF.SVG Visual Interaction**: LLM generates interactive SVG frames → User provides coordinate-based input with element identification → LLM responds with contextual visual updates

**Technical Characteristics**:
- **Declarative output**: LLM produces pure SVG markup without imperative JavaScript/HTML/CSS code generation
- **Context adaptation**: Generated interfaces dynamically adjust to conversational state, user proficiency level, and device capabilities
- **Bidirectional coordination**: User interaction coordinates and SVG element IDs transmitted to LLM for state updates
- **Deterministic execution**: Declarative SVG eliminates runtime errors inherent in generated imperative code

**Application Domains**:
- **Technical repair guidance**: Component identification in circuit board diagrams with progressive detail revelation upon user selection
- **Visual information retrieval**: Dynamic menu generation with semantic annotations, responding to user selection with detailed data visualization
- **Diagnostic analysis**: Schematic generation with state visualization, interactive element selection triggering contextual explanations

This architectural approach enables language models to function as **declarative visual interface generators**, producing dynamic, context-specific user interfaces without requiring pre-programmed GUI implementations or imperative scripting.

For complete technical details, see:
- [Section 13: Streaming Capabilities](FBF.SVG/FBF_SVG_SPECIFICATION.md#13-streaming-capabilities)
- [Section 14: Interactive Visual Communication Protocol](FBF.SVG/FBF_SVG_SPECIFICATION.md#14-interactive-visual-communication-protocol)
- [FBF.SVG Full Specification](FBF.SVG/FBF_SVG_SPECIFICATION.md)

### SVG 2.0 Mesh Gradient Support

svg2fbf provides native support for **SVG 2.0 mesh gradients** (`<meshgradient>` elements) present in input frame documents. Mesh gradient creation is supported by SVG 2.0-conformant editors including **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)** and other tools implementing the SVG 2.0 specification.

When mesh gradient elements are detected during processing, svg2fbf conditionally injects a lightweight JavaScript polyfill (~16KB) to ensure cross-browser rendering compatibility, including user agents lacking native SVG 2.0 mesh gradient support. This polyfill constitutes the **only** permissible JavaScript content in FBF.SVG documents per specification.

For a complete list of supported SVG features, see **[SUPPORTED_SVG_FEATURES.md](docs/SUPPORTED_SVG_FEATURES.md)**.

---

## Input Frame Requirements

svg2fbf accepts a sequence of SVG files as input frames. Each frame must meet these requirements:

### File Naming

**Recommended format**: Use 5-digit zero-padded numbering for best compatibility:
```
frame_00001.svg
frame_00002.svg
frame_00003.svg
...
frame_00099.svg
```

This format ensures proper alphabetical sorting and clear frame ordering. Other numbering schemes work but may cause sorting issues with some tools.

### SVG Format Requirements

- **Valid SVG files**: Each frame must be a valid SVG 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0 document
- **Supported tools**: Export from [Inkscape](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape), [OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz), [Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender) (Grease Pencil), or any SVG editor
- **One frame per file**: Each SVG file should contain only one animation frame
- **Static content**: Frames must be static images (no SMIL animations or interactive elements)
- **Consistent dimensions**: Use the same viewBox and dimensions across all frames to avoid distortion

### Resources and Assets

- **External resources**: Linked images, fonts, and other resources are automatically downloaded and embedded as base64 data URIs
- **Embedded resources**: Already-embedded base64 resources are preserved
- **No external dependencies**: Final FBF.SVG file is completely self-contained

### Advanced Features

- **Mesh gradients**: SVG 2.0 mesh gradients fully supported (Inkscape-compatible)
- **Filters**: Supported but may impact playback performance on slower systems
- **CSS styles**: Parsed and converted to SVG attributes (native SVG attributes are faster)

### Not Supported

- SVG layers (content will be flattened)
- Nested SVG elements
- JavaScript in source frames
- SMIL animations in source frames

For detailed technical information, see [Supported SVG Features](docs/SUPPORTED_SVG_FEATURES.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Problem: "No SVG files found in input directory"

**Cause**: svg2fbf cannot find `.svg` files in the specified directory.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the directory path: `ls your_directory/` should show `.svg` files
- Ensure files have `.svg` extension (not `.SVG` or `.svg.txt`)
- Use absolute paths if relative paths aren't working:
  ```bash
  svg2fbf -i /full/path/to/frames/ -o /full/path/to/output/
  ```
- Check file permissions: `ls -la your_directory/`

#### Problem: "Invalid viewBox" or misaligned frames

**Cause**: SVG frames have inconsistent `viewBox` attributes.

**Solutions**:
- Open all frame SVGs and ensure they have identical `viewBox` values
- Example: All frames should have `viewBox="0 0 800 600"`
- Use your SVG editor to standardize the canvas size before exporting
- svg2fbf will warn you about viewBox inconsistencies

#### Problem: Animation plays too fast or too slow

**Cause**: Incorrect FPS setting for the desired animation speed.

**Solutions**:
- Calculate target FPS: `fps = total_frames / desired_duration_in_seconds`
- Example: 120 frames over 5 seconds = 24 FPS
- Adjust with `-s` or `--speed` parameter:
  ```bash
  svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg -s 24
  ```
- Common FPS values:
  - 12 FPS: Choppy, retro style
  - 24 FPS: Cinema standard
  - 30 FPS: Smooth animation
  - 60 FPS: Very smooth, high-quality

#### Problem: Huge file size

**Cause**: Lack of element deduplication.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure consistent elements across frames (identical objects should be pixel-perfect duplicates)
- Remove unnecessary complexity from source SVGs:
  - Simplify paths in your SVG editor (Path → Simplify in Inkscape)
  - Merge similar colors
  - Remove hidden or duplicate elements
- Check deduplication is working: svg2fbf should report shared elements found

#### Problem: Validation errors

**Cause**: Generated FBF.SVG doesn't meet format requirements.

**Solutions**:
- Run the validator to see specific errors:
  ```bash
  python scripts/validate_fbf.py output/animation.fbf.svg --verbose
  ```
- Common validation issues:
  - **External resources**: Embed all images as data URIs (svg2fbf does this automatically)
  - **Scripts**: Remove `<script>` elements from source SVGs
  - **Invalid metadata**: Use `--title`, `--creator` flags to add proper metadata
  - **Frame ID mismatch**: Let svg2fbf generate IDs automatically

#### Problem: Animation doesn't loop

**Cause**: Animation mode not set correctly.

**Solutions**:
- Use `--loop` flag for infinite looping (default):
  ```bash
  svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg --loop
  ```
- For single playthrough:
  ```bash
  svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg --once
  ```
- For ping-pong (forward then backward):
  ```bash
  svg2fbf -i frames/ -o output/ -f animation.fbf.svg --pingpong
  ```

#### Problem: Browser doesn't show animation

**Cause**: Browser doesn't support SMIL animations or SVG file is malformed.

**Solutions**:
- Check browser compatibility:
  - ✅ Chrome/Edge: Full support
  - ✅ Firefox: Full support
  - ✅ Safari: Full support
  - ❌ IE11: No SMIL support (use modern browser)
- Validate the SVG:
  ```bash
  python scripts/validate_fbf.py output/animation.fbf.svg
  ```
- Try opening in a different browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Ensure file was saved correctly (not truncated or corrupted)

#### Problem: Click-triggered animation doesn't work

**Cause**: Interactive features may not be properly configured or browser security settings.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `begin="click"` is present in the animation element
- Try opening the file via `file://` protocol directly in browser
- Some browsers may block events on SVGs loaded in `<img>` tags - use `<object>` or `<embed>`:
  ```html
  <object data="animation.fbf.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
  ```
- Check browser console for security errors

#### Problem: Memory issues with large animations

**Cause**: Hundreds of frames or very complex frames.

**Solutions**:
- Split long animations into episodes/chapters
- Reduce frame complexity (simplify paths, merge elements)
- Consider streaming approach for very long animations (see FBF.SVG specification)

### Still Having Issues?

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf/issues) for similar problems
2. Run validator with `--verbose` flag for detailed diagnostics
3. Try with one of the working examples first to verify your setup
4. Open a new issue with:
   - svg2fbf version (`svg2fbf --version`)
   - Python version (`python --version`)
   - Operating system
   - Complete error message
   - Minimal reproduction example

## Origin

The need of a specific format for vector animations was clear when the OpenToonz program was made open source.
As a member of the OpenToonz community I started to study a way to create a format that would be open, widely compatible and easily reproduced. 
The FBF.SVG format was the result of my research: a subset of the SVG 2.0 standard designed to become the MP4 of vector animations.
The first fbf.svg files were published on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Emasoft/pen/vYWwdZm) on June 2022.
svg2fbf is the first tool implementing the frame-by-frame SVG animation, inspired by early experiments in SVG animation builders.
