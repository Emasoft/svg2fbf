## Branch Workflow & Development Stages

svg2fbf uses a **4-stage branch workflow** to separate development phases and enforce quality gates at the right time.

### Development Pipeline Overview

```
dev → testing → review → master → main
 ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓       ↓
alpha   beta     rc     stable  (mirror)
```

### Branch Workflow Table

| Branch    | Purpose                        | Stage          | CI/CD    | Hooks     | Tests Expected | Clone & Checkout (gh CLI)                  | Promotion Command          | Install Command         | Release Type |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| `dev`     | Active feature development     | Development    | Disabled | Manual    | ❌ May fail    | `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b dev`  | `just promote-to-testing`  | `just install-alpha`    | alpha        |
| `testing` | Bug hunting & fixing           | Testing/QA     | Disabled | Manual    | ❌ Will fail   | `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b testing` | `just promote-to-review`   | `just install-beta`     | beta         |
| `review`  | Final review & approval        | Pre-release    | ✅ Enabled | Available | ✅ Must pass   | `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b review` | `just promote-to-stable`   | `just install-rc`       | rc           |
| `master`  | Production-ready stable code   | Production     | ✅ Enabled | Available | ✅ Must pass   | `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b master` | (syncs to main)            | `just install-stable`   | stable       |
| `main`    | GitHub default (mirror master) | Production     | ✅ Enabled | Available | ✅ Must pass   | `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf` (default)  | `just sync-main`           | `just install-stable`   | (none)       |

**Note:** `gh repo clone` accepts multiple formats:
- **Owner/Repo**: `gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b BRANCH` (shown above)
- **HTTPS URL**: `gh repo clone https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf.git -- -b BRANCH`
- **SSH URL**: `gh repo clone git@github.com:Emasoft/svg2fbf.git -- -b BRANCH`

**Important:** Git URLs do not support embedding branch names in the URL itself. You must always use the `-b` or `--branch` flag. There is no syntax like `git@github.com:user/repo.git#branch` or `git@github.com:user/repo.git@branch` that works.

### Detailed Branch Descriptions

#### 1. **dev** - Development Branch
- **Purpose**: Active feature development and patches
- **Quality Level**: Code may be broken, incomplete, or experimental
- **CI/CD**: ❌ **Disabled** - Developers iterate quickly without CI blocking
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Available but developers choose when to run
- **Tests**: Expected to fail - work in progress
- **When to use**: All new features start here
- **Promotion**: When feature is complete → `just promote-to-testing`

**Development workflow on dev:**
```bash
git checkout dev
# ... work on features ...
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push origin dev

# Manually test when ready
just test    # Optional
just lint    # Optional

# When feature complete
just promote-to-testing
```

#### 2. **testing** - Testing/QA Branch
- **Purpose**: Bug hunting, QA testing, debugging
- **Quality Level**: Features complete but bugs expected
- **CI/CD**: ❌ **Disabled** - Tests are supposed to fail here!
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Available but not enforced
- **Tests**: Expected to fail until all bugs fixed
- **When to use**: After features merged from dev
- **Promotion**: When all bugs fixed and tests pass → `just promote-to-review`

**Testing workflow:**
```bash
git checkout testing
# ... receive code from dev ...
# ... testers find bugs ...

# Developers fix bugs
git commit -m "fix: Handle edge case in parser"
git push origin testing

# Keep fixing until all tests pass
just test

# When all tests pass
just promote-to-review
```

#### 3. **review** - Review/RC Branch
- **Purpose**: Final review before production release
- **Quality Level**: All tests passing, ready for final approval
- **CI/CD**: ✅ **Enabled** - Strict enforcement, all checks must pass
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Enforced
- **Tests**: Must pass - this is the quality gate
- **When to use**: Final checks before stable release
- **Promotion**: When approved → `just promote-to-stable`

**Review workflow:**
```bash
git checkout review
# ... receive code from testing ...
# ... final review, documentation checks ...

# CI runs automatically - must pass
# Manual final checks
just test
just lint
just check

# When approved
just promote-to-stable
```

#### 4. **master** - Production Branch
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready releases
- **Quality Level**: Highest - only fully tested, approved code
- **CI/CD**: ✅ **Enabled** - Strict enforcement
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Enforced
- **Tests**: Must pass
- **When to use**: Only after review approval
- **Release**: `just publish` - Creates GitHub releases + PyPI publish

**Master workflow:**
```bash
# After promotion from review
git checkout master

# Create releases
just publish  # All 4 channels + PyPI

# main branch auto-syncs with master
```

#### 5. **main** - GitHub Default Branch
- **Purpose**: Mirror of master for GitHub compatibility
- **Quality Level**: Same as master
- **CI/CD**: ✅ **Enabled** - Strict enforcement
- **Sync**: Automatically syncs with master after stable releases
- **Manual sync**: `just sync-main` if needed

### Why CI is Disabled on dev/testing

**The problem**: If CI ran on every push to `dev` or `testing`, it would constantly fail and block your workflow.

**The solution**: Developers manually decide when to run checks:

```bash
# On dev or testing branches, run checks manually when ready:
just test          # Run test suite
just lint          # Check code style
just check         # Run all checks (lint + test)
```

**Quality gates**: CI only enforces on `review`, `master`, and `main` where code must be stable.

### Branch Promotion Commands

```bash
# Promote through the pipeline
just promote-to-testing   # dev → testing (feature complete)
just promote-to-review    # testing → review (bugs fixed)
just promote-to-stable    # review → master (approved)
just sync-main            # master → main (manual sync)
```

### Branch Equalization Command

The `just equalize` command synchronizes ALL branches to match the current branch. This is different from promotion, which follows the sequential dev→testing→review→master pipeline.

```bash
# Equalize all branches from current branch
just equalize
```

**What it does:**
1. Detects which branch you're currently on
2. Fetches latest from remote
3. **Warns you** if any other branches have commits not in your current branch
4. Shows you which commits would be lost
5. Asks for confirmation ("yes" required, not just "y")
6. Force-syncs all branches (dev, testing, review, master, main) to match current branch
7. Pushes all branches to remote with `--force-with-lease`
8. Returns you to your original branch

**Example output when branches are ahead:**
```
⚠️  WARNING: Some branches have newer commits!
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ⚠️  dev has 3 commit(s) not in main
      Latest: a1b2c3d feat: Add new feature

If you continue, these commits will be LOST!

💡 Consider switching to one of these branches first:
   git checkout dev && just equalize
```

#### When to Use `just equalize` vs `just promote-*`

**Use `just equalize` when:**
- ✅ **Critical hotfix on master/main** that needs to go everywhere immediately
- ✅ **Emergency security patch** that can't wait for the normal pipeline
- ✅ **Windows CI fixes** or other infrastructure updates needed on all branches
- ✅ **After manual hotfix** that bypassed the normal promotion flow
- ✅ **Synchronizing after recovery** from divergent branch states
- ✅ **When all branches should be at the SAME commit** (like after a release)

**Use `just promote-*` when:**
- ✅ **Normal feature development** - Let features flow through the pipeline
- ✅ **Following the quality gates** - Testing catches bugs, review approves
- ✅ **Different code on different branches is expected** - That's the point!
- ✅ **Maintaining development workflow** - dev ahead of testing is normal
- ✅ **Want to preserve branch-specific work** - Don't lose commits

#### Key Differences

| Aspect | `just equalize` | `just promote-*` |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Direction** | Any branch → all others | Sequential: dev→testing→review→master |
| **Merge type** | Force-sync (reset) | Merge (preserves history) |
| **Branches affected** | ALL branches | Just the next branch in pipeline |
| **Commit history** | Overwrites everything | Preserves commit history |
| **Use case** | Emergency synchronization | Normal development flow |
| **Risk** | ⚠️ HIGH - Can lose commits | ✅ LOW - Merges preserve work |
| **Warnings** | Shows which commits will be lost | No warnings (safe merge) |

#### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Critical Windows CI Fix** ✅ Use `just equalize`
```bash
# You fixed a critical Windows encoding bug on main
git checkout main
# ... fix the bug ...
git commit -m "fix: Windows Unicode encoding in ppp()"

# Now all branches need this fix immediately
just equalize
# All branches now have the fix
```

**Scenario 2: New Feature Development** ✅ Use `just promote-*`
```bash
# You developed a new feature on dev
git checkout dev
# ... implement feature ...
git commit -m "feat: Add new export format"

# Feature is complete, move to testing
just promote-to-testing
# dev stays ahead with new feature
# testing now has the feature for QA
```

**Scenario 3: Emergency Security Patch** ✅ Use `just equalize`
```bash
# Critical security vulnerability discovered
git checkout master
# ... apply security patch ...
git commit -m "security: Fix XSS vulnerability"

# This needs to be on ALL branches NOW
just equalize
# All branches protected immediately
```

**Scenario 4: Bug Fix During Testing** ✅ Use `just promote-*`
```bash
# Bug found on testing branch
git checkout testing
# ... fix the bug ...
git commit -m "fix: Handle null viewBox attribute"

# Bug is fixed, ready for review
just promote-to-review
# testing stays at current state
# review now has the bug fix
```

#### Safety Features

The `just equalize` command includes several safety features:
- 🔍 **Detects branch divergence** - Shows which branches have commits not in current
- ⚠️ **Clear warnings** - Tells you exactly what will be lost
- 💡 **Smart suggestions** - Recommends switching to the newer branch first
- 📡 **Fetches before checking** - Ensures you have latest remote state
- 🔒 **Force-with-lease** - Won't overwrite if remote changed since last fetch
- ✋ **Requires "yes"** - Typing just "y" won't work, must type full "yes"

### Release Commands

```bash
# Create releases on GitHub (no PyPI)
just release

# Create releases + publish stable to PyPI
just publish
```

For complete release workflow documentation, see [docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md](docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md).

### Installing Released Versions

Each branch has a corresponding install command to install directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Install from specific branches
just install-alpha    # Install latest from dev branch (alpha)
just install-beta     # Install latest from testing branch (beta)
just install-rc       # Install latest from review branch (rc)
just install-stable   # Install latest from master branch (stable)

# Install local development version
just build            # Build wheel from current code
just install          # Install the built wheel
```

**Use cases:**
- **Testing releases**: Install alpha/beta/rc to test before promoting
- **User installation**: Use `just install-stable` for production
- **Development**: Use `just build && just install` for local testing

### Common Development Patterns

**Pattern 1: New Feature**
```bash
git checkout dev
# ... implement feature ...

# Test locally
just build
just install
svg2fbf --version  # Verify

# Promote when ready
just promote-to-testing
# ... fix bugs found in testing ...
just promote-to-review
# ... final approval ...
just promote-to-stable
just publish
```

**Pattern 2: Hotfix**
```bash
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
# ... fix bug ...
git checkout master
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git push origin master
just publish
```

**Pattern 3: Testing Pre-releases**
```bash
# Install and test alpha release
just install-alpha
svg2fbf --version
# ... test alpha ...

# Install and test beta release
just install-beta
svg2fbf --version
# ... test beta ...

# Install stable when approved
just install-stable
```

**Pattern 4: Local Development**
```bash
git checkout dev
# ... make changes ...
just test   # Check if tests pass
just lint   # Check code style

# Test local build
just build
just install
svg2fbf --version  # Should show current version

# Continue working or promote if ready
just promote-to-testing
```

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: ≥3.10
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: Package and project manager
- **[yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)**: YAML/JSON/XML processor (install via `brew install yq` on macOS)
- **Node.js**: Required for test suite (Puppeteer rendering)
- **Git**: For version control

### Initial Setup

**⚠️ DEVELOPERS: Always clone the repository, never install from PyPI/releases!**

PyPI and GitHub releases exclude large test data (93MB+ of test sessions). Developers need the full repository with all test suites.

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository (RECOMMENDED: use GitHub CLI)
# Method 1: Owner/Repo format (shortest)
gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf
cd svg2fbf
git checkout dev        # for alpha development (most common)

# Method 2: Clone and checkout in one command (recommended)
# gh repo clone Emasoft/svg2fbf -- -b dev

# Method 3: Using full URL
# gh repo clone https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf.git -- -b dev

# Alternative: standard git clone
# git clone https://github.com/Emasoft/svg2fbf.git
# cd svg2fbf
# git checkout dev

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Initialize uv project (creates pyproject.toml if needed)
uv init --python 3.12

# Sync dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Single Virtual Environment Policy

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **ONE and ONLY ONE** virtual environment located at the project root:

```
svg2fbf/
└── .venv/        ← THE ONLY VENV (project root)
```

**DO NOT** create additional virtual environments in subdirectories:

```
❌ WRONG: svg2fbf/tests/.venv/
❌ WRONG: svg2fbf/src/.venv/
❌ WRONG: svg2fbf/docs/.venv/
```

**Why this matters:**
- Multiple venvs cause dependency conflicts
- Wasted disk space (each venv is ~50-100MB)
- Confusing execution context (which Python is running?)
- Build and test failures due to missing dependencies

**If you accidentally created a venv in a subdirectory:**
```bash
# Remove it immediately
rm -rf tests/.venv
rm -rf src/.venv
rm -rf docs/.venv

# Always work from project root
cd /path/to/svg2fbf
uv sync
```

**Always run commands from the project root:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: From project root
cd svg2fbf
uv run python tests/testrunner.py run 5

# ❌ WRONG: From subdirectory (creates local .venv!)
cd svg2fbf/tests
uv venv  # DON'T DO THIS!
```

## Installation for Development

There are multiple ways to install svg2fbf for development:

### Option 1: Editable Installation in Virtual Environment

This is the recommended approach for active development:

```bash
# After setting up the virtual environment
uv pip install -e .

# Now you can run svg2fbf from the venv
svg2fbf --version
```

With editable installation (`-e`), changes to `svg2fbf.py` take effect immediately without reinstalling.

### Option 2: Install as uv Tool (Development Mode)

Install svg2fbf globally as a uv tool from your local development folder:

```bash
# Install from current directory as editable tool
uv tool install --dev .

# Or install from a specific local directory
uv tool install --dev /path/to/svg2fbf

# Run from anywhere
svg2fbf --version
```

The `--dev` flag creates an editable installation, so changes to the code take effect immediately.

### Option 3: Build and Install from Wheel (Development Build)

Build a development wheel and install it:

```bash
# Build development wheel
uv build --dev

# This creates:
# - dist/svg2fbf-{version}.tar.gz (source distribution)
# - dist/svg2fbf-{version}-py3-none-any.whl (wheel)

# Install the wheel as a tool
uv tool install dist/svg2fbf-{version}-py3-none-any.whl --python 3.10
```

## Building

### Quick Development Build (Recommended)

For rapid development cycles, use the `just` commands:

```bash
# Build development wheel (NO version bump)
just build

# Install built wheel
just install

# Or do both at once (full rebuild)
just reinstall
```

**What `just build` does:**
1. Gets current version from pyproject.toml
2. Gets short git hash for local version identifier
3. Creates development version with +dev.{hash} suffix (PEP 440 compliant)
4. Builds wheel with development version (e.g., `0.1.2a15+dev.cb48211`)
5. Restores original version in pyproject.toml
6. No version bumping - versions only change during releases

**Development builds** get a unique suffix based on git commit hash, allowing you to:
- Build multiple times without version changes
- Distinguish development builds from releases
- Test code without affecting version numbers

**Release builds** (clean, no suffix) are created by:
- `just release` - Create releases on GitHub (all 4 channels)
- `just publish` - Create releases + publish stable to PyPI

### Build Process Details

#### Development Build

```bash
# Build with development dependencies
uv build --dev

# Output files in dist/:
# - svg2fbf-{version}.tar.gz
# - svg2fbf-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production (no dev dependencies)
uv build --python 3.10

# Specify output directory
uv build --python 3.10 --out-dir build/
```

#### Verify Build

```bash
# Uninstall previous version if installed
uv tool uninstall svg2fbf

# Install built wheel locally to test
uv tool install dist/svg2fbf-*.whl --python 3.10

# Test the installation
svg2fbf --version
svg2fbf -i examples/seagull/ -o /tmp -f test.fbf.svg -s 12
```

### What's Included in Releases

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:**
- **End users**: Install from PyPI or GitHub releases (small, fast downloads)
- **Developers**: MUST clone the repository (full test data required)

To keep release packages lightweight, **large test data is excluded** from wheels and source distributions:

**Excluded from releases** (developers get these by cloning):
- `tests/sessions/` - 93MB+ of SVG test frames and session data
- `tests/**/*.zip` - Compressed test archives
- Development scripts and tools
- Complete git history

**Included in releases** (end users get these):
- Core source code
- Essential runtime scripts (node_scripts, package.json)
- Unit tests (small, fast-running tests)
- Documentation

**Package sizes**:
- **PyPI/GitHub releases (end users)**: ~129KB wheel
- **Full repo clone (developers)**: ~93MB+

This design allows:
- ✅ Fast PyPI/GitHub releases for end users (129KB)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites for developers (clone repo)
- ✅ CI/CD can still run tests (GitHub Actions clones full repo)
- ✅ No wasted bandwidth for users who just want to use the tool

## Testing

svg2fbf includes a comprehensive test suite with pixel-perfect validation.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Test-Generated FBF Files Are NOT Valid for Production

**WARNING**: When using the `testrunner.py` helper script, the generated FBF.SVG files are **NOT valid for production use**. Here's why:

1. **Missing Metadata**: Without a proper YAML config file, testrunner.py cannot generate FBF files with proper metadata (title, creators, description, etc.). The generated FBF files lack required RDF/XML metadata for Full Conformance.

2. **Test-Specific Settings**: Test FBF files use specialized generation settings optimized for frame comparison testing:
   - **1 FPS only** (for reliable Puppeteer frame capture)
   - **Auto-start** (`begin="0s"` instead of `begin="click"`)
   - **Play once** (`repeatCount="1"` instead of `"indefinite"`)
   - **No interactivity** (testing requires deterministic playback)

3. **For Production Use**: Always use `svg2fbf.py` directly with a proper YAML configuration file (or pass all metadata via CLI parameters) to generate valid, production-ready FBF.SVG animations.

**Note**: You CAN pass a YAML generation file to testrunner.py using the unified syntax:
```bash
testrunner.py --yamlfile nameoftheyamlfile.yml -- <path1> [path2] [path3] ...
```
The unified `--` separator accepts mixed inputs (folders and/or individual SVG files). Examples:
```bash
# Folder mode
testrunner.py --yamlfile config.yml -- /path/to/folder

# File list mode
testrunner.py --yamlfile config.yml -- frame1.svg frame2.svg frame3.svg

# Mixed inputs
testrunner.py --yamlfile config.yml -- /path/to/folder extra_file.svg

# Random selection from W3C SVG 1.1 Test Suite (root level only, no recursion)
testrunner.py create --random 50 -- "FBF.SVG/SVG 1.1 W3C Test Suit/w3c_50frames/"
just test-random-w3c 50  # Convenient alias
```
However, this is only for special tests that need to actually test the ability of svg2fbf to generate valid FBF.SVG files with valid metadata, or to test the interactivity with Playwright test scripts. Normal tests do not require a YAML file to be passed to testrunner.py.

**Test FBF files are saved in `tests/sessions/session_XXX_Nframes/` directories and should NEVER be distributed or used as examples.**

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run with HTML visual comparison report
uv run pytest tests/ --html-report

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_frame_rendering.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=svg2fbf --cov-report=html
```

### Test Tolerance System

The test suite uses a **two-level tolerance approach** for image comparison:

1. **Pixel-Level Tolerance** (`--pixel-tolerance`): Color difference threshold per pixel
   - Default: `0.0039` (≈ 1 RGB value difference in normalized 0-1 range)
   - Range: `0.0` (exact match) to `1.0` (any difference accepted)

2. **Image-Level Tolerance** (`--image-tolerance`): Percentage of pixels allowed to differ
   - Default: `0.04%` (0.0004 fraction)
   - Range: `0.0%` (all pixels must match) to `100%` (any number of different pixels)

### Test Tolerance Presets

```bash
# Pixel-perfect comparison (zero tolerance)
uv run pytest tests/ --pixel-tolerance 0.0 --image-tolerance 0.0

# Very strict (sub-pixel differences allowed)
uv run pytest tests/ --pixel-tolerance 0.001 --image-tolerance 0.001

# Default (production setting)
uv run pytest tests/ --pixel-tolerance 0.0039 --image-tolerance 0.04

# Lenient (for development/debugging)
uv run pytest tests/ --pixel-tolerance 0.01 --image-tolerance 0.1
```

| Preset | Pixel Tolerance | Image Tolerance | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Pixel-Perfect** | 0.0 | 0.0 | Exact match required |
| **Very Strict** | 0.001 | 0.001% | Near-perfect (sub-pixel differences) |
| **Default** | 0.0039 | 0.04% | Production setting |
| **Lenient** | 0.01 | 0.1% | Development/debugging |

## Code Quality

### Formatting and Linting

svg2fbf uses **ruff** for both formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code (auto-fix)
uv run ruff format svg2fbf.py tests/

# Format with custom line length
uv run ruff format --line-length=320 svg2fbf.py tests/

# Check linting issues
uv run ruff check svg2fbf.py tests/

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix svg2fbf.py tests/
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Run mypy type checker
uv run mypy svg2fbf.py

# Run with strict mode
uv run mypy --strict svg2fbf.py
```

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing code, run:

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format svg2fbf.py tests/

# Check linting
uv run ruff check svg2fbf.py tests/

# Type check
uv run mypy svg2fbf.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Version Management

svg2fbf uses **automatic version management** via `uv`. Version is stored in `pyproject.toml` and displayed on every execution.

### Standard Version Bumps

```bash
# Check current version
svg2fbf --version

# Bump patch version (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
uv version --bump patch

# Bump minor version (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
uv version --bump minor

# Bump major version (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
uv version --bump major
```

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions allow you to publish test versions before the final release.

#### Creating the First Pre-release

To create the first alpha, beta, or release candidate, you need to bump both the version level AND the pre-release type:

```bash
# Create first alpha (0.1.0 → 0.1.1a1)
uv version --bump patch --bump alpha

# Create first beta (0.1.0 → 0.1.1b1)
uv version --bump patch --bump beta

# Create first release candidate (0.1.0 → 0.1.1rc1)
uv version --bump patch --bump rc
```

#### Incrementing Pre-release Numbers

Once you're in a pre-release cycle (alpha, beta, or rc), you can increment just the pre-release number **without bumping the patch version**:

```bash
# Increment alpha version (0.1.1a1 → 0.1.1a2)
uv version --bump alpha

# Increment alpha again (0.1.1a2 → 0.1.1a3)
uv version --bump alpha

# Switch to beta (0.1.1a3 → 0.1.1b1)
uv version --bump beta

# Increment beta version (0.1.1b1 → 0.1.1b2)
uv version --bump beta

# Switch to release candidate (0.1.1b2 → 0.1.1rc1)
uv version --bump rc

# Increment rc version (0.1.1rc1 → 0.1.1rc2)
uv version --bump rc
```

#### Finalizing a Release

To finalize a pre-release version to a stable release, bump the patch version:

```bash
# Finalize from pre-release to stable (0.1.1rc2 → 0.1.1)
uv version --bump patch
```

### Complete Pre-release Workflow Example

Here's a typical pre-release cycle for version 0.2.0:

```bash
# Current version: 0.1.5
# Starting development of 0.2.0

# Create first alpha
uv version --bump minor --bump alpha    # → 0.2.0a1

# Fix bugs, increment alpha
uv version --bump alpha                 # → 0.2.0a2
uv version --bump alpha                 # → 0.2.0a3

# Ready for beta testing
uv version --bump beta                  # → 0.2.0b1

# Fix issues, increment beta
uv version --bump beta                  # → 0.2.0b2
uv version --bump beta                  # → 0.2.0b3

# Ready for release candidate
uv version --bump rc                    # → 0.2.0rc1

# Final testing, increment rc if needed
uv version --bump rc                    # → 0.2.0rc2

# Everything looks good, finalize release
uv version --bump minor                 # → 0.2.0 (stable release)
```

### Version Workflow Checklist

1. **Make changes** and test thoroughly
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with changes
3. **Bump version**:
   - For pre-release: `uv version --bump <type>`
   - For stable release: `uv version --bump <patch|minor|major>`
4. **Build package**: `uv build --python 3.10`
5. **Test built package**:
   ```bash
   uv tool uninstall svg2fbf
   uv tool install dist/svg2fbf-*.whl --python 3.10
   ```
6. **Run full test suite**: `uv run pytest tests/`
7. **Commit version bump**: `git add pyproject.toml && git commit -m "Bump version to $(svg2fbf --version)"`
8. **Tag release**: `git tag v$(svg2fbf --version | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+[a-z]*\d*')`
9. **Push with tags**: `git push && git push --tags`

### Pre-release Distribution

Pre-release versions can be distributed for testing:

```bash
# Build pre-release
uv build --python 3.10

# Uninstall stable version if installed
uv tool uninstall svg2fbf

# Install pre-release for testing
uv tool install dist/svg2fbf-0.2.0a1-py3-none-any.whl --python 3.10

# Test the pre-release
svg2fbf --version  # Should show 0.2.0a1
```

### Version Naming Convention

svg2fbf follows [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning:

| Version Format | Example | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `X.Y.Z` | `1.2.3` | Stable release |
| `X.Y.ZaN` | `1.2.3a1` | Alpha release (N = alpha number) |
| `X.Y.ZbN` | `1.2.3b1` | Beta release (N = beta number) |
| `X.Y.ZrcN` | `1.2.3rc1` | Release candidate (N = rc number) |

**Version component meanings:**
- **X (major)**: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **Y (minor)**: New features, backwards-compatible
- **Z (patch)**: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

## Development Tips

### Quick Development Cycle

**Fastest workflow** (recommended):
```bash
# 1. Make changes to svg2fbf.py

# 2. Rebuild and reinstall in one command
just reinstall

# 3. Test the installed version
svg2fbf -i examples/seagull/ -o /tmp -f test.fbf.svg -s 12

# 4. Run specific test
just test-file tests/test_frame_rendering.py
```

**Alternative workflow** (without reinstalling):
```bash
# 1. Make changes to svg2fbf.py

# 2. Run quick test directly (uses current source)
uv run python svg2fbf.py -i examples/seagull/ -o /tmp -f test.fbf.svg -s 12

# 3. Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_frame_rendering.py::test_seagull_animation -v

# 4. Check code quality
uv run ruff check svg2fbf.py
```

### Debugging Test Failures

```bash
# Run with verbose output and keep test files
uv run pytest tests/ -v --html-report

# Check the generated comparison report
open tests/results/session_XXX/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/comparison_report.html

# Examine diff images
ls -l tests/results/session_XXX/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/diffs/
```

### Working with YAML Configs

```bash
# Create test config
cat > test_config.yaml <<EOF
metadata:
  title: "Test Animation"
  creators: "Developer"

generation_parameters:
  input_folder: "examples/seagull/"
  output_path: "/tmp/test/"
  filename: "test.fbf.svg"
  speed: 12.0
EOF

# Test with config
uv run python svg2fbf.py test_config.yaml
```
